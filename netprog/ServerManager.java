    Purpose:
        ServerManager sits as the overhead manager of several Servers (one for 
        each specified port in the command line arguments). 
        
    Methods:
        To Be Described Later

    Protocol:
        <SEND msg id>: Send msg to the client represented by id
        <BROADCAST msg>: Send msg to EACH client 
        <ME IS id>: Declare identity
